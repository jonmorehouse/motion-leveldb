# Rubymotion Leveldb
> A rubymotion friendly api around Leveldb

## Dependencies

I don't have time to write this project to use a native ruby library or to add in the leveldb library yet myself, so for now it requires cocoapods and uses the ObjectiveLevelDB pod

When I have time, I'll be rewriting this library to use leveldb from the groundlevel in a much more ruby-friendly fashion. My goal is for the api to not change betweeen now and then.
